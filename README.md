It's a web application which is used for empowering maternal mental wellbeing using AI

## Problem Statement

Peripartum Depression (PPD) affects 1 in 7 mothers during or after pregnancy, but many go undiagnosed due to stigma and a lack of accessible resources. This untreated condition can lead to a range of emotional, physical, and developmental issues that affect both the mother and child, causing lasting harm if not addressed in time.

Current solutions often fall short, failing to offer personalized and ongoing support after a diagnosis. As a result, many mothers are left to navigate this challenging period alone, which increases the risk of long-term consequences for their mental and physical health.

## Problem Solution

An AI-powered system can detect early signs of Peripartum Depression (PPD) through a simple self-assessment process. By using advanced algorithms, the system helps identify potential symptoms before they escalate, allowing for timely recognition and intervention.

Once signs of PPD are detected, the system offers personalized, real-time support through tailored advice, coping strategies, and access to professional help. This ensures that mothers receive the guidance they need, specifically addressing their unique challenges and emotional state.

The platform is designed to be easy to use, ensuring continuous assistance throughout the peripartum period. It provides a seamless and accessible experience, empowering mothers to get the support they need, right when they need it.
